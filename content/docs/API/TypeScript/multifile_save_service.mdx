## Anchor::TypeScript::MultifileSaveService

A utility to save files generated by `Anchor::TypeScript::MultifileSchemaGenerator`.

### Example

```ruby
generator = Anchor::TypeScript::MultifileSchemaGenerator.new(
  register: Schema.register,
  manually_editable: true,
)
Anchor::TypeScript::MultifileSaveService.call(
  generator:,
  folder_path: "test/files/multifile",
  force: false
)
puts "âœ… test/files/multifile"
```

## `.call` Parameters

### generator

- Type: `Anchor::TypeScript::MultifileSchemaGenerator`

### folder_path

- Type: `String`

Folder where the files will be saved.

### force

When `true`, the contents of an existing file will be fully overwritten by the contents of the generated file.

When `false`:

If the existing file is detected to be manually editable (i.e. `// START AUTOGEN` and `// END AUTOGEN` generated by the generator are present) then:

- If the corresponding file's generated content is manually editable then replace the text between `// START AUTOGEN` and `// END AUTOGEN` in the existing file with the text between those markers in the generated files.
- If not, an error is thrown. To fix, ensure either
  - the generator was initialized with `manually_editable: true`
  - or use `force: true` if you no longer want to use a manually editable schema.

If the existing file is not manually editable then the existing will be fully overwritten regardless of `force`. Currently, only `shared.ts` will be completely overwritten.
