## Attributes

An attribute's type is inferable if:

- the underlying ActiveRecord model of the resource has a type definition for the attribute
- the method for the attribute is not overridden in the model
- the method for the attribute is not overridden in the resource

### Example

```ruby
class UserResource < ApplicationResource
  attribute :name # => Anchor::Types::String
  attribute :bio # => Anchor::Types::Maybe.new(Anchor::Types::String)
  attribute :role # => Anchor::Types::String if Anchor.config.use_active_record_validations is true (true is default)
  attribute :model_override # => Anchor::Types::Unknown
  attribute :resource_override # => Anchor::Types::Unknown

  def resource_override
    nil
  end
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates :role, presence: true

  def model_override
    nil
  end
end

# db/schema.rb snippet
create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.string "name", null: false
  t.string "bio"
  t.string "role"
  t.string "model_override"
  t.string "resource_override"
end
```

`JSONAPI::Resource` attributes are inferred via introspection of the resource's
underlying ActiveRecord model.

`ActiveRecord::Base.columns_hash[attribute]` is used to get the SQL type and is
then mapped to an `Anchor::Type` in
`Anchor::Types::Inference::ActiveRecord::SQL.from`.

### Relevant Configs

- [`use_active_record_validations`](../API/configuration/#use_active_record_validations)
  - use ActiveModel validations on the ActiveRecord model to determine nullability
- [`ar_column_to_type`](../API/configuration/#ar_column_to_type) - custom type mapping
- [`rbs`](../API/configuration/#rbs) - use RBS

## Relationships

### Example

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :posts
  has_one :posts
end

class UserResource < ApplicationResource
  relationship :posts, to: :many # => Anchor::Types::Array.new(Anchor::Types::Reference.new("Post"))
end

class Post < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :deleted_by, class_name: "User", optional: true
end

class PostResource < ApplicationResource
  relationship :user, to: :one # => Anchor::Types::Reference.new("User")
  relationship :deleted_by, to: :one, class_name: "User" # => Anchor::Types::Maybe.new(Anchor::Types::Reference.new("User"))
end

```

The [`.anchor_schema_name`](../API/schema_serializable#anchor_schema_name) of the related resource is used as the type identifier in the TypeScript serializer.
The nullability and cardinality are determined by the underlying ActiveRecord model's reflections, `ActiveRecord::Base.reflections[name]`.

| ActiveRecord Association               | Inferred `Anchor::Type` (TypeScript expression) |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `belongs_to :relation`                 | `Relation`                                      |
| `belongs_to :relation, optional: true` | `Maybe<Relation>`                               |
| `has_one :relation`                    | `Maybe<Relation>`                               |
| `has_many :relations`                  | `Array<Relation>`                               |
| `has_and_belogs_to_many :relations`    | `Array<Relation>`                               |

### Relevant Configs

- [`infer_nullable_relationships_as_optional`](../API/configuration/#infer_nullable_relationships_as_optional)
  - whether to use e.g. `{ relation?: Relation }` or `{ relation: Maybe<Relation> }`
